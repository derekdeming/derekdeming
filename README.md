# Derek Deming üë®üèª‚Äçüíª

**`NEW-ish... GITHUB PROFILE... not really "new" anymore but old one was lost`**  

**`"Full Stack" ML Engineer and Researcher with expertise in Software Engineer / MLOps & Infra / Security`**  


I'm full-stack machine learning engineer and software engineer building solutions to make this world a better place. I believe in solving problems that actually exist rather than slapping the title of "AI" on it and call it an "innovative solution". All coding projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code. I love to think about problems & product, play video games, and indulge in all kinds of food. I have two dogs with my partner and trying to figure out where I fit in this AI revolution we are having.

 <summary><h3>üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Derek's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my programming journey a bit later than others. I was a premed student studying biology and chemistry in undergrad while also being interested in research. I did research all 4 years in physical inorganic chemistry which is where i was first introduced to programming via complex data analysis. I was using languages like R, Julia, python and matlab. I was always learning and trying new things but at the end of undergrad i knew my interests were more aligned with pursuing research than premed... 
   
   I graduated from college with a direct entrance into a PhD program where I was able to do applied (ML) statistical chemistry research on porous material design. I utilized experimental, computational, and theoretical methodology during my graduate studies. I received the Distinguished Graduate Research Fellowship Award to be funded for the rest of my PhD. COVID hit and my introspective time spent alone found me to fall in love with computer science to the point where I left my PhD with a Master‚Äôs to pursue computational research. I performed DFT, Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations on mutated proteins to understand the energetics when proteins fold.
   
   I eventually shifted towards industry to learn best practices and advance my career further. I became the first hire at a startup within Coca Cola as a ML data scientist where I built out their entire ML platform utilizing Databricks, Snowflake/Snowpark, and Azure DevOps as our cloud pipeline providers. Eventually I transitioned into ML infrastructure where I worked as a Data Platform Software Engineer on the MLOps team at a financial firm. Most recently I have joined Microsoft Security work on AI/ML safety and security. This journey has not been linear and I never pictured myself here today 7 years ago but I wouldn‚Äôt change a part of it. The journey has been incredible and I have enjoyed it every step of the way! I am looking forward to building my own projects and contributing to open source projects.
