# Derek Deming üë®üèª‚Äçüíª

**`NEW GITHUB PROFILE!!!-- old one was lost`**  

**`"Full Stack" Machine Learning Engineer / Software Engineer / MLOps`**  

**`Former Researcher and Innovative Thinker`**  


I'm full-stack machine learning engineer and software engineer building solutions to make this world a better place. I believe in solving problems that actually exist rather than slapping the title of "AI" on it and call it an "innovative solution". All coding projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code. I love to think about problems & product, play video games, and indulge in all kinds of food. I have two dogs with my partner and trying to figure out where I fit in this AI revolution we are having.

 <summary><h3>üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Derek's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my coding journey a bit later than others. I was a premed student studying biology and chemistry in undergrad. I was a student researcher all four years of undergrad doing complex data analysis which is really where my coding journey started. I had a burning passion to learn everything I could about the interdisciplinary field of applied computational biochemistry - code, machine learning, protein design, statistical modeling. And all the while, teaching myself computer science the dream of becoming a medical doctor (MD) dissipated and my love for research and understanding the world began to thrive. I graduated from college with a direct entrance into a PhD program where I was able to do applied (ML) statistical chemistry research on porous material design. I utilized experimental, computational, and theoretical methodology during my graduate studies. I received the Distinguished Graduate Research Fellowship Award to be funded for the rest of my PhD. COVID hit and my introspective time spent alone found me to fall in love with computer science to the point where I left my PhD with a Master‚Äôs to pursue a fully computational research role. I performed DFT, Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations on mutated proteins to understand the energetics when proteins fold. This was a complete shift in what I was doing prior and I really enjoyed it. I eventually shifted towards industry to learn best practices and advance my career further. I became the first hire at a startup within Coca Cola as a ML data scientist where I built out their entire ML platform utilizing Databricks, Snowflake/Snowpark, and Azure DevOps as our cloud providers. Eventually I left to start my journey in ML infrastructure where I am currently working as a Data Platform Software Engineer on the MLOps team at a financial company. This journey has not been linear and I never pictured myself here today but I wouldn‚Äôt change a part of it. The journey has been incredible and I have enjoyed it every step of the way! I am looking forward to building my own projects and contributing to open source projects.
